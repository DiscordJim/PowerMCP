PowerMCP is an open-source collection of MCP servers for power system software like PowerWorld and OpenDSS. These tools enable LLMs to directly interact with power system applications, facilitating intelligent coordination, simulation, and control in the energy domain.

## üåü What is MCP?

The <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction" target="_blank">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP) is a revolutionary standard that enables AI applications to seamlessly connect with various external tools. Think of MCP as a universal adapter for AI applications, similar to what USB-C is for physical devices. It provides:

- Standardized connections to power system software and data sources
- Secure and efficient data exchange between AI agents and power systems
- Reusable components for building intelligent power system applications
- Interoperability between different AI models and power system tools

## ü§ù Our Community Vision

We're building an open-source community focused on accelerating AI adoption in the power domain through MCP. Our goals are:

- **Collaboration**: Bring together power system experts, AI researchers, and software developers
- **Innovation**: Create and share MCP servers for various power system software and tools
- **Education**: Provide resources and examples for implementing AI in power systems
- **Standardization**: Develop best practices for AI integration in the energy sector

## üöÄ Getting Started with MCP

### Video Demos

Check out these demos showcasing PowerMCP in action:

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbF-SlBI4Ws" target="_blank">**Contingency Evaluation Demo**</a>: An LLM automatically operates power system software, such as PowerWorld and pandapower, to perform contingency analysis and generate professional reports.

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euFUvhhV5dM" target="_blank">**Loadgrowth Evaluation Demo**</a>: An LLM automatically operates power system software, such as PowerWorld, to evaluate different load growth scenarios and generate professional reports with recommendations.

### Useful MCP Tutorials

MCP follows a client-server architecture where:

* **Hosts** are LLM applications (like Claude Desktop or IDEs) that initiate connections
* **Clients** maintain 1:1 connections with servers, inside the host application
* **Servers** provide context, tools, and prompts to clients

### Using with LLMs

To use these MCP tools with an LLM:

1. Install the MCP Python SDK:
```bash
pip install mcp-server-git
```

2. Run your MCP server:
```bash
python your_server.py
```

3. Configure your LLM application (e.g., <a href="https://claude.ai/download" target="_blank">Claude Desktop</a>, <a href="https://www.cursor.com/" target="_blank">Cursor</a>) to use the MCP server:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "servername": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["your_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```
